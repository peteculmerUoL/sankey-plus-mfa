# Sankey-Plus-MFA

 A modification of the working version (0.6) of Sankey-Plus - particularly for Material Flow Analyses 
 (See original readme below)
 Not offially branched from the original's github because this has updates which have broken it (for me at least).
 Future work will integrate updates from the original where possible.
 With thanks and recognition to the excellent original Sankey-Plus library - hopefully this work could be merged back in the future

***NOT READY FOR USE YET - CONTAINS BUGS :)***

A JavaScript library for computing and drawing Sankey graphs.

Based on the [D3-Sankey](https://github.com/d3/d3-sankey) and D3-Sankey-Circular(https://github.com/tomshanley/d3-sankey-circular) libraries, and the experiments in my [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@tomshanley/sankey-circular-deconstructed-part-2-manual-scaling/2).  

This library enhances those to provide:

* Handling for circular links
* Routing of long links to avoid overlapping nodes
* Improved layout
* New API that uses a config object


## API Reference

Import *SankeyChart* from *sankeyPlus.js*:

```JavaScript
import { SankeyChart } from './sankeyPlus.js'
```

Create a new chart:

```JavaScript
let chart = new SankeyChart(element, config);
```

* **element**: An HTML element, such as a DIV, which will contain the SVG element created by SankeyChart.draw()
* **config**: an options object containing the configuration for the sankey chart.

To render the chart, call the *draw()* method, which creates an SVG element in the specified HTML element:

```JavaScript
chart.draw();
```

## Config options:

The config options has the structure:

```JavaScript
let config = {
    //main options
    nodes: {
        //data and options for nodes
    },
    links: {
        //data and options for links
    },
    arrows: {
        //data and options for links
    }
}
```
### Main
| Option      | Description | Default       | Mandatory       |
| ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- | ----------- | 
| justify      | Title       | Left       |  No     |
| id   | If id is specified, sets the node id accessor to the specified function        | d => d.name      |   No    |
| iterations   | The number of relaxation iterations        | 32        | No        |
| padding   | Padding around the chart, in pixels        | 20        | No        |
| width   | Width of the chart   | 1000        | No        |
| height   | Height of the chart        | 500        | No        |
| useManualScale   | TBC  True/False       | True        | No      |

### Nodes
| Option      | Description | Default       | Mandatory       |
| ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- | ----------- | 
| data      | An array of nodes objects, which must contain a property for the ID that is specified in the **id** option (the default is **name**).      | NA      |  Yes       |
| width   | Width of the node, in pixels        | 25        | No        |
| maxHeight   | If useManualScale is enabled, then the maximum height of the node for the scale's range        | 75        | No        |
| padding   | The ideal vertical space between each node          | 25        | No        |
| minPadding   | The minimum vertical space allowed between each node        | 25        | No        |
| virtualPadding   | The vertical space between nodes and any virtual links which are routed around nodes        | 7        | No        |
| horizontalSort   | Boolean. If set to true, the node objects must contain a property `horizontalSort` (Number). The values of this property will be used for the horizontal position. This applies Sankey charts with circular links where the 'first' node(s) is arbitrary. If null or false, the sort order of the nodes are based on in incoming/outgoing links.        | null        | No        |
| verticalSort   | Boolean. If set to true, the node objects must contain a property `verticalSort` (Number). The values of this property will be used for the vertical position, for nodes within the same column. If null or false, the sort order of the nodes is optimized for the best layout.        | null        | No        |
| setPositions   | If true, then the nodes' positions aren't optimised vertical.        | false        | No        |

### Links
| Option      | Description | Default       | Mandatory       |
| ---------- | ----------- |  ----------- | ----------- | 
| data      | An array of links objects, which must contain a **source**, **target** and **value** property. The source and target must refer to a node's ID.      | NA       |  Yes       |
| circularGap   | Text        | 5        | No         
| circularLinkPortionTopBottom   | The portion of the Height  that should be reserved for drawing circular links      | 0.4          | No        |
| circularLinkPortionLeftRight   | The portion of the Width that should be reserved for drawing circular links        |  0.1         | No        |
| useVirtualRoutes   | Text        | Text        | No        |
| virtualPadding   | Text        | Text        | No        |
| baseRadius   | Text        | Text        | No        |
| verticalMargin   | Text        | Text        | No        |
| opacity   | Opacity of the link stroke, from 0 to 1        | 1        | No        |
| virtualLinkType   | Text        | Text        | No        |
